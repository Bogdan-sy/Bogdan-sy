## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my first attemp of creating something on GitHub.

# What I Learned  

I learned the basics of Git and GitHub.  
- How to create and manage repositories.  
- How to use branches and commits.  
- How to collaborate using pull requests.  

I still need to practice a lot more, but Iâ€™m excited to keep learning.
